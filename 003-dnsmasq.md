# dnsmasq

Light software that can act both as DNS server/cache and as DHCP server.  
In the virtual LAN, only the DNS part is used, in order to resolve internal names with first-level domain *.scambi* (not a TLD).

These document is for "normal" servers.  

## Procedure

> apt install dnsmasq

>nano /etc/default/dnsmasq

  	add ",.hosts,.resolv" to CONFIG_DIR variable

check that the line below is decommented in the file /etc/dnsmasq.conf  

    conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,*.conf


>nano /etc/dnsmasq.d/dnsmasq.resolv

    nameserver 192.168.64.1
    nameserver 192.168.64.2
    nameserver 9.9.9.9

>nano /etc/dnsmasq.d/dnsmasq.conf

    #not read /etc/hosts
    no-hosts
    # don't read /etc/resolv.conf
    #no-resolv
    resolv-file=/etc/dnsmasq.d/dnsmasq.resolv
    # follow order of servers
    strict-order

    # number of names in cache
    cache-size=4096

    # add domain to simple names
    expand-hosts

    # ttl cache
    max-cache-ttl=1800

    # interface
    interface=lo
    # accept dns queries only from address of local subnet
    local-service
    # force binding only on selected interfaces
    bind-interfaces

    # not forward query without fqdn
    domain-needed

edit the file /etc/resolv.conf by inserting the following line at the top  

    nameserver 127.0.0.1

edit the file /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf, if present, by uncommenting the following line  

    prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;

enable and start the service  
>systemctl enable --now dnsmasq  
>systemctl restart dnsmasq


## Fix DNS - Contabo

nano /etc/network/interfaces

    ...
    dns-nameservers 127.0.0.1 213.136.95.10 213.136.95.11
    ...

>systemctl disable --now resolvconf  
>rm /run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf  
>rm /var/run/resolvconf/interface/*  
>apt remove resolvconf  
>systemctl restart dnsmasq

>ls -l /etc/resolv.conf

if the file */etc/resolv.conf* is a symbolic link:  
>rm /etc/resolv.conf

>nano /etc/resolv.conf

    nameserver 127.0.0.1

# Tips
If you run into problems like that dnsmasq want to use a file under `/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf` add here the nameservers and then `sudo systemctl stop resolvconf` then restart dnsmasq
